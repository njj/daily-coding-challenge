# Daily Coding Challenge

I am always interested in working to solve fun problems. I also know there are
a hundred different ways to solve a single problem. So, for this
[Hacktoberfest][1] I wanted to make a way for beginners and advanced
programmers alike to have an easy way to contribute to open source while
flexing their coding muscles.

## Process
Each day I will submit one coding challenge. I will accept answers to that
challenge in any language. The hope is that there will be a couple different
ways to answer any one challenge in a single language and I'd like to see those
variations.

If I can't think of a problem that seems interesting or fun then I will use one
distributed by [DailyCodingProblem.com][2] or pull one from [Project Euler][3]

When you have created a working solution please open a pull request!

### PR Comments
I want to encourage PR comments. I would like them to stay very positive and
helpful. Our main goal should be teaching something new. If you have a faster
or better way of doing something then open another PR!

## Tips

* Think of different time and space complexities
* Think of different ways of solving e.g.: loops vs recursion
* Add instructions on how to run your solution to the top
* Try a new language!

## Testing
To test your solutions, use Node CLI to execute the test runner and pass the path of your solution i.e.:

`node runner.js 01-make-change/recursive-es6.js`
